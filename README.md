# OpenEHR EHR REST API TEST
Test utility to verify the correctness of different OpenEhr EHR REST API
implementations. See the [OpenEhr EHR REST API proposal](https://www.openehr.org/releases/ITS/latest/ehr_restapi.html)

Could be used as a .NET test project in existing implementations by adding it
as a git submodule.
